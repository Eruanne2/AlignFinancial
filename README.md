# Overview

[Align Financial](https://align-financial.herokuapp.com/#/), an [Ally Bank](https://www.ally.com/bank/) clone, is an online-only bank that offers interest checking, high-yield savings, and money market accounts. Because Align has no offices and all business is conducted online, their website is a clean interface designed around functionality and easy navigation.
